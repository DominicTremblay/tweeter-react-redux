# Breakout Plan:

## Explain class vs stateless components

- example of a state component: NewTweet
- example of a stateless component: Article

## Data Flows: data down, action up

- explain state and props
- explain how the tweets are passed down to Article
- explain how to pass down a function as props

## Manage the state

- How to call this.setState
- Explain that it needs to be used in the parent

## Binding

- Show the potential bindings of postTweet

## PropTypes

- Show propTypes on NewTweet, AllTweets, Article

## How to add CSS to React

- Component based approach
